The focus is to analyze and predict the
functionality of water pumps in Tanzania. We employed different
data mining techniques on the data set provided, which contains
several features of the water pump, including the quality, quantity
and location. Multiple machine learning algorithms were then
used to train and evaluate the models. By analyzing the various
features of the water points, the models were able to pinpoint the
factors that contribute towards the operational status of the water
pumps with a reasonable level of accuracy. We implemented
Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, GradientBoost and TabNet
algorithms along with a stack classifier to predict the accuracy of
the model. We were able to achieve 80.68 as the highest accuracy
after comparing the models.
